    "Introduction": "Man-Bat (Dr. Robert Kirkland) is a fictional supervillain, and anti-hero appearing in comic books published by DC Comics. Introduced in Detective Comics #400 (June 1970) as an enemy of the superhero Batman,the character has since endured as one of the Dark Knight's most prominent villains, and belongs to the collective of adversaries that make up his rogues gallery.Man-Bat originated as an anthropomorphic, feral, bat-like creature, lacking sentience and acting purely on instinct, the result of Langstorm testing a serum that could supposedly give humans a bat's acute sonar sense on himself.\r\n",
    "LookingFor": "By taking his bat-gland formula, Kirk Langstrom can transform himself into a bat-like creature. By taking an antidote or if the bat-gland formula wears off, he can return to human form. As the Man-Bat, his strength, agility and endurance are all enhanced to superhuman levels. Kirk possesses an extra set of digits that form leathery bat wings that allow him to fly, super-sensitive hearing, and sonar. He emits high-pitched sound waves and can hear the echoes they make when they bounce off nearby objects, enabling the Man-Bat to navigate perfectly in pitch black darkness. If in the Man-Bat form for a prolonged time, he loses control over his bestial side and works purely on instinct, making him prone to harm friend and foe alike.\r\n",
    "Interests": " Batman managed to reverse the effects, but Langstrom would return as Man-Bat time and time again, albeit not necessarily as a villain, as Langstrom would sometimes retain enough sanity to use his powers for good.\r\n",

    "Introduction": "The Riddler (Edward Nigma, also known as Edward Nygma or Edward Nashton) is a fictional supervillain appearing in comic books. He first appeared in Detective Comics #140 (October 1948). The Riddler is commonly depicted as a criminal mastermind in Gotham City who takes delight in incorporating riddles and puzzles into his schemes, leaving them as clues for the authorities to solve. The Riddler is one of the most enduring enemies of the superhero Batman and belongs to the collective of adversaries that make up his rogues gallery.\r\n",
    "LookingFor": "The Riddler has an obsession with riddles, puzzles, and word games. The character frequently delights in over-stating his \"intellectual superiority\" and on forewarning both Batman and the police of his capers by sending them complex clues. His name is a pun itself, Edward Nigma (Enigma – a person or thing that is difficult to understand). With this self-conscious use of a gimmick, Riddler's crimes are flamboyant and ostentatious and usually he is depicted as less violent than other major Batman villains such as the Joker or Two-Face. The character is depicted as wearing a domino mask either with a green unitard with question mark prints, or a green suit and bowler hat. A black, green, or purple question mark serves as his visual motif.\r\n",
    "Interests": "Riddle: I am an odd number. Take away a letter and I become even. What number am I?\nAnswer: Seven.",

Others in the Batman family feel differently; for instance, Tim Drake has a good relationship with her.

Debuting as \"the Cat\" in Batman #1 (spring 1940), she is one of the Dark Knight's most enduring enemies and belongs to the collective of adversaries that make up his rogues' gallery.

    "LookingFor": "Catwoman is a Gotham City burglar who typically wears a tight, one-piece outfit and uses a bullwhip for a weapon. She was originally characterized as a supervillain and adversary of Batman, but she has been featured in a series since the 1990s which portrays her as an antiheroine, often doing the wrong things for the right reasons.\r\n",
    "Interests": "The character thrived since her earliest appearances, but she took an extended hiatus from September 1954 to November 1966 due to the developing Comics Code Authority in 1954. These issues involved the rules regarding the development and portrayal of female characters that were in violation of the Comics Code, a code which is no longer in use. In the comics, Holly Robinson and Eiko Hasigawa have both adopted the Catwoman identity, apart from Selina Kyle.",

    "Interests": "Her superpower, the canary cry, allows her to create ultrasonic vibrations whenever she screams, allowing her to severely damage both organic and inorganic objects. Her canary cry has been depicted as having 10-fold the capabilities of most sonic weapons and has even been depicted as breaking metals and having the resonance to affect and shatter Earth. In The New 52, her canary cry now grants her the ability to glide and propel herself across long distances by screaming downwards. Due to this reliance on speech, she is often bound and gagged by villains as a means of incapacitation. Despite her power, the Black Canary often relies on her martial arts skills instead, preferring to use her canary cry only during urgent situations, such as against superpowered opponents.",
